  SAY ~Shadow Adept~
  SAY ~SHADOW ADEPT: Shadow adepts hurl themselves into the abyss of the Shadow Weave, immediately acquiring all the gifts available to casual students and discovering secrets unavailable to all but the most dedicated.

Advantages:
 - Hit Die: d6
 - May use Shadow Magic.

SHADOW MAGIC: Spells of the Shadow Weave are usually more powerful than regular magic, but drains the caster's life force. When a spell is cast, the shadow adept must make a save vs. death at +5 minus spell level (e.g. +4 for level 1, -4 for level 9) or temporarily lose Constitution equal to the level of the spell cast for 3 rounds. If the shadow adept's Constitution reaches zero, <PRO_HESHE> is killed instantly.

The Shadow Weave is a mysterious and dark entity, far more alien and harder to control than that of Mystra's equivalent. As such, a great amount of mental acuity is required in order to master shadow magic. High intelligence, wisdom and charisma benefits those who choose to stray into Shar's domain.

- Gains the Darkvision innate ability.

DARKVISION: The shadow adept is gifted with the ability to see in the dark even better than in light. <PRO_HESHE> permanently gains infravision and immunity to blindness.

 - May cast one additional spell per level.
 - +2 bonus to saving throws against spells of the Enchantment, Illusion and Necromancy schools.
 - 4th level: May use the Shield of Shadows ability once per day.
 
SHIELD OF SHADOWS: The shadow adept surrounds <HIMHER>self with a barrier of purpleblack force. This shield of shadows functions like a shield spell, setting <HISHER> armor class to 4 (2 against ranged weapons) and absorbing magic missiles cast at him for 1 hour per 2 levels to a maximum of 9 hours.

From 8th level onwards, the shield of shadows also grants +4 to saving throws vs. death and +1 to all other saving throws.

 - 5th level: May use Shadowstep once per day. Gains one use every 5 levels thereafter.
 
SHADOWSTEP: Step into the Shadow Plane and move for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time. The shadow adept cannot attack or use spells while in the Shadow Plane.

 - 14th level: May use the Shadow Double ability once per day.
 
SHADOW DOUBLE: The shadow adept creates a copy of himself out of shadowstuff. The copy is at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level.

Disadvantages:
 - -2 penalty to saving throws against spells of the Invocation and Alteration schools.
 - May not learn or use spells from the Weave.
 - Alignment restricted to non-good.

	biography = RESOLVE_STR_REF (~There is a dark secret hidden within the walls of Candlekeep, forbidden to be spoken of among the scribes and monks even in hushed voices. A well of shadow magic, fueled by darkness and loss, shunned by most practitioners of the arcane arts. Such powers originate from the realm of the Shadow Weave, the distorted mockery of Mystra's Weave created by Shar, the Nightsinger. So obscure is this power that most are unaware of its existence, and those that know of it refuse to acknowledge it due to its dark origins. However, the seductive whispers of this power has called to you, an apprentice mage who had barely mastered your first cantrip, since a young age, deep beneath the great library.

When the voices became too much to resist, you snuck into the depths of Candlekeep in the dead of night, where unwanted and dangerous secrets are left to rot. Inside of a once-sealed chamber stood a strange fountain, an open wound in the Prime Material Plane through which the energies of the Shadow Weave bled. As soon as you touched the eerie yet beautiful strands of magic that flowed from the wound, you felt an awakening as your connection to the Weave was severed and the power of Shar's dark Weave coursed through you in its place, bestowing upon you a magic that few are gifted with. As you matured, the growing magic within you developed a symbiotic connection until it became one with your very being, and the power of the Shadow Weave became subservient to your will. Gorion and your tutors grew wary of the strange magic that you wielded, though they never learned of the source. Though you knew the dangers of toying with Shar's domain were great, the temptation of such a little-known power in your hands were a thousand times worth the cost.~)

All targets within range take 1d4+2 fire damage and have their Luck reduced by two points for 2 rounds + 1 round per level to a maximum of 10 rounds at 9th level, additionally, they take 2 points of fire damage per round for the duration.

Duration: 5 rounds

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When Dark Mirage is cast, the shadow adept causes the outline of <PRO_HISHER> form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty. The shadow adept also gains a +1 bonus to all of <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws. Additionally, the caster causes from 2 to 8 exact duplicates of <PRO_HIMHER>self to come into being around <PRO_HIMHER>. These images do exactly what the shadow adept does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual shadow adept. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack—magical or otherwise—it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead.

The creature targeted must have less than 20 Hit Points and gets no Saving Throw. Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses. The Sleep effect will last for 5 rounds. This spell has no effect on creatures with more than 20 Hit Points.

At 10th level, creatures above 20 Hit Points are put to sleep for 2 rounds.~

The shadow adept launches an unstable mass of shadowstuff which explodes, dealing 1d3 points of cold damage and 1d3 points of magic damage for every level of the caster (to a maximum of 10d6) and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1 per 10 levels of the caster (-2 at 10th level, -3 at 20th level, etc.) for 1 turn. Creatures who pass their saving throw (-1 penalty per 5 levels) avoid the direct blast taking no magic damage or stat loss.

In addition, the target transfers 3 points of either Strength, Dexterity or Constitution to the caster. The Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points and statistics last for 1 hour.

Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms - or attempts to harm - the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.

The saving throw penalty increases by -1 for every 5 caster levels.~

Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 7.5 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who save vs. Spell at -4 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Upon casting this spell, a spear made of shadowstuff forms in the caster's hands, which can be thrown once towards a target of the caster's choosing. The spear pierces through all targets in its path, dispelling all of the spell protections of 5th level and lower affecting it. This includes the following spells: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Minor Spell Turning. If no such spells protect the targets, the spear instead deals 5d6 and inflicts an additional effect dependent on the caster's level.

5th level and below: Reduces targets' Armor Class by two points for five rounds
8th-10th level: Reduces targets' saving throws and THAC0 by 1 point for five rounds
11th-13th level: Halves targets' Dexterity for one turn
14th-16th level: Drains two levels from targets for one turn

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Expunge Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the effective level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled (Expunge Magic is cast as though at 1.5x the caster's actual level). The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Expunge Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Expunge Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Saving Throw: None 

When a shadow adept casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of shadowstuff will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the shadow adept in no way. The effect of this is to protect the shadow adept from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level shadow adept would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level shadow adept would receive 10. For each skin the shadow adept possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level shadow adept would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the shadow adept until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the shadow adept from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.

Additionally, so long as at least one layer of Shadeskin is active, the shadow adept gains 25% resistance to acid, cold, fire, electrical and magic damage.~

Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces - a shimmering - allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. For the duration of the spell, the shadow adept is also able to backstab with a x2 multiplier, increased to x3 at level 14 and x4 at level 21.

Additionally, the caster's movement rate is doubled, allowing for a quick retreat from battle if necessary.

Note: After making an attack, the shadow adept is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the shadow adept.~

Thus, a 12th-level shadow adept will cause 6d6 (half electrical, half fire) damage to a victim (3d6 electrical if the victim makes <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw vs. Spell).~

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2 

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. Additionally, mages will take 4d10 magic damage and suffer from a 50% chance of spell failure for 2 rounds. Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell, he calls forth a swarm of venomous biting and stinging shadow creatures to plague the target. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d6 points of damage from bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or run away in fear. If a successful save vs. breath at -6 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

This spell is blocked by any form of fire shield.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a shadow adept casts Shadow's Refuge, <PRO_HESHE> opens a gate to a safe (in relative terms) pocket area in the Plane of Shadow, where time passes more slowly and gives <PRO_HIMHER> time to rest and recuperate away from the present battle. For one turn, the shadow adept is safe from combat and <PRO_HISHER> hit points are restored to full, and <PRO_HESHE> regains two spells of each spell level of 7th level and below when <PRO_HESHE> returns.

WARNING: Using this spell without other party members causes a game over!~

Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the caster with a brief and short-sighted degree of prescience, enough to predict events in the immediate future and react to them in advance. For 4 rounds, the shadow adept gains a bonus of 20 to Armor Class, a +20 bonus to hit, +20 to all saves and immunity to backstabs. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the shadow adept a few rounds in the thick of combat.~

Area of Effect: Party
Saving Throw: None

This powerful but dangerous spell temporarily turns the caster into a gateway for the energies of the Shadow Weave, which <PRO_HESHE> may control and bestow upon <PRO_HISHER> allies for as long as <PRO_HESHE> can maintain it. For an indefinite amount of time, the shadow adept is unable to make any actions as <PRO_HESHE> channels power into <PRO_HISHER> party, hasting them, providing a +4 bonus to all attributes, +6 to Armor Class, +4 to to-hit and damage modifiers, +50% magic resistance, +50% resistance to elemental damage and immunity to level drain. However, for each round the link is maintained, the caster suffers 1d6 points of magic damage (save vs. death to avoid) and <PRO_HESHE> is completely vulnerable to attack unless <PRO_HESHE> breaks the connection. Additionally, if <PRO_HESHE> ends the channel, the backlash causes <PRO_HIMHER> to become stunned for 2 rounds unless a save vs. death at -2 is made.~

This spell fires a bolt of necrotic energy which rends the soul of its target. Targets who fail a save vs. death at -2 have their maximum hit points cut in half for five rounds. Even if the target makes its save, they take 5d6+10 magic damage and their magic resistance, if any, is nullified for five rounds. This spell is not affected by magic resistance.

If this spell kills its target, the caster temporarily gains a 50% bonus to their maximum hit points for 1 turn and regains two spells of 8th level or below.~

When Nightsinger's Tithe is uttered, one creature within the spell range is slain. The target must have 60 or fewer current Hit Points, otherwise the spell has no effect. There is no Saving Throw.

There is an 50% chance that killing a target with this spell will permanently bestow 1 bonus hit point to the caster.

Saving Throw: None 

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining the target of two levels of experience every round for four rounds. A saving throw vs. death at -4 can be made to avoid losing levels after the first round. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. Additionally, the caster is restored of 1-4 lost spells of 8th level or below for every instance of level loss of the target.~

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift about three feet long.

The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Also, every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated.

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes. The target first gets a save vs. spells at -4 to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a save vs. death at -2 or die from fear. If a subject succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage.~

When Oblivion Pull is cast, the shadow adept launches a tiny, fast-moving projectile towards a target which spawns a portal at the targeted location. The portal remains for 3 rounds. At the beginning of each round, all creatures that fail a saving throw vs. spells at -3 within a 10' radius will be pulled towards the portal. After 3 rounds have passed, all creatures within a 5' radius of the portal are pulled into it and sent to a small pocket in the Shadow Plane where they are trapped indefinitely. The victim remains there unless the spell "Freedom" is cast. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then <PRO_HESHE> will reappear exactly where <PRO_HESHE> was last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. There is no Saving Throw against imprisonment.~

  SAY ~Shadow Disciple~
  SAY ~SHADOW DISCIPLE: Shadow disciples are born with the innate ability to wield magic of the Shadow Weave, usually granted as a blessing from Shar, the Nightsinger. Like their equivalent, the sorcerer, they wield the power of their native magic, the Shadow Weave, with a level of skill that other spellcasters would envy.

Advantages:
 - Hit Die: d6
 - May use Shadow Magic.

SHADOW MAGIC: Spells of the Shadow Weave are usually more powerful than regular magic, but drains the caster's life force. When a spell is cast, the shadow disciple must make a save vs. death at +5 minus spell level (e.g. +4 for level 1, -4 for level 9) or temporarily lose Constitution equal to the level of the spell cast for 3 rounds. If the shadow disciple's Constitution reaches zero, <PRO_HESHE> is killed instantly.

The Shadow Weave is a mysterious and dark entity, far more alien and harder to control than that of Mystra's equivalent. As such, a great amount of mental acuity is required in order to master shadow magic. High intelligence, wisdom and charisma benefits those who choose to stray into Shar's domain.

- Gains the Darkvision innate ability.

DARKVISION: The shadow disciple is gifted with the ability to see in the dark even better than in light. <PRO_HESHE> permanently gains infravision and immunity to blindness.

 - +2 bonus to saving throws against spells of the Enchantment, Illusion and Necromancy schools.
 - 4th level: May use the Shield of Shadows ability once per day.
 
SHIELD OF SHADOWS: The shadow disciple surrounds <HIMHER>self with a barrier of purpleblack force. This shield of shadows functions like a shield spell, setting <HISHER> armor class to 4 (2 against ranged weapons) and absorbing magic missiles cast at him for 1 hour per 2 levels to a maximum of 9 hours.

From 8th level onwards, the shield of shadows also grants +4 to saving throws vs. death and +1 to all other saving throws.

 - 5th level: May use Shadowstep once per day. Gains one use every 5 levels thereafter.
 
SHADOWSTEP: Step into the Shadow Plane and move for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time. The shadow disciple cannot attack or use spells while in the Shadow Plane.

 - 14th level: May use the Shadow Double ability once per day.
 
SHADOW DOUBLE: The shadow disciple creates a copy of <HIMHER>self out of shadowstuff. The copy is at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level.

Disadvantages:
 - -2 penalty to saving throws against spells of the Invocation and Alteration schools.
 - May not learn or use spells from the Weave. (Spells chosen on level-up will be erased)
 - Alignment restricted to non-good.~

  SAY ~Nightsinger~
  SAY ~NIGHTSINGER: A rare class of bards that choose to study the power of the Shadow Weave gain access to its dark powers, bestowing upon them a dirge capable of cursing their enemies.

Advantages:
 - The Nightsinger's Bard Song, "Dirge of Despair", curses <PRO_HISHER> enemies, reducing their morale and saving throws.
	1st level: -1 penalty to THAC0, damage and saving throws, lowers morale
	11th level: -2 penalty to THAC0, damage and saving throws, lowers morale
	21st level: -3 penalty to THAC0, damage and saving throws, lowers morale

 - May use Shadow Magic.

SHADOW MAGIC: Spells of the Shadow Weave are usually more powerful than regular magic, but drains the caster's life force. When a spell is cast, the shadow adept must make a save vs. death at +5 minus spell level (e.g. +4 for level 1, -4 for level 9) or temporarily lose Constitution equal to the level of the spell cast for 3 rounds. If the shadow adept's Constitution reaches zero, <PRO_HESHE> is killed instantly.

The Shadow Weave is a mysterious and dark entity, far more alien and harder to control than that of Mystra's equivalent. As such, a great amount of mental acuity is required in order to master shadow magic. High intelligence, wisdom and charisma benefits those who choose to stray into Shar's domain.

- Gains the Darkvision innate ability.

DARKVISION: The shadow adept is gifted with the ability to see in the dark even better than in light. <PRO_HESHE> permanently gains infravision and immunity to blindness.

 - May cast one additional spell per level.
 - +2 bonus to saving throws against spells of the Enchantment, Illusion and Necromancy schools.
 - 6th level: May use the Shield of Shadows ability once per day.
 
SHIELD OF SHADOWS: The shadow adept surrounds <HIMHER>self with a barrier of purpleblack force. This shield of shadows functions like a shield spell, setting <HISHER> armor class to 4 (2 against ranged weapons) and absorbing magic missiles cast at him for 1 hour per 2 levels to a maximum of 9 hours.

From 8th level onwards, the shield of shadows also grants +4 to saving throws vs. death and +1 to all other saving throws.

 - 7th level: May use Shadowstep once per day. Gains one use every 5 levels thereafter.
 
SHADOWSTEP: Step into the Shadow Plane and move for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time. The shadow adept cannot attack or use spells while in the Shadow Plane.

 - 18th level: May use the Shadow Double ability once per day.
 
SHADOW DOUBLE: The shadow adept creates a copy of <HIMHER>self out of shadowstuff. The copy is at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level.

Disadvantages:
 - -2 penalty to saving throws against spells of the Invocation and Alteration schools.
 - May not learn or use spells from the Weave. (Spells chosen at character creation will be erased)
 - Alignment restricted to True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral or Neutral Evil.~

This spell only needs to be cast once; upon casting, the shadow adept summons a creature from the Plane of Shadow to become <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. However, this magical contract made between the caster and summon requires a sacrifice from the shadow adept. Upon casting this spell, the shadow adept loses four points of Constitution which gradually recovers over the course of four weeks. However, as the summoned creature is not native to the Prime Material Plane and usually unliving, they cannot be 'killed' in battle and if they are destroyed will reform after 24 hours have passed with no harm dealt to their summoner. Shadow familiars grow stronger with their caster and gain new abilities upon their master reaching certain experience thresholds.

The creature summoned by this spell is determined by the caster's alignment on the law-chaos axis.
