When Dark Mirage is cast, the shadow adept causes the outline of <PRO_HISHER> form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty. The shadow adept also gains a +1 bonus to all of <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws. Additionally, the caster causes from 2 to 8 exact duplicates of <PRO_HIMHER>self to come into being around <PRO_HIMHER>. These images do exactly what the shadow adept does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual shadow adept. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack—magical or otherwise—it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

Range: Touch 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.

Additionally, if the target is either a shadow adept or a native of the Shadow Plane, they are healed for 1d6 hit points (+1d6 per five caster levels).~

Using this spell, the shadow adept may choose to temporarily change to any alignment of their choice for eight hours. For all intents and purposes, the caster is treated as though they are of the selected alignment to determine reactions, spell effects and item restrictions. Any alignment-detecting magic will also detect the caster as being of their false alignment. After eight hours, the caster's alignment is reverted to normal.~

(Illusion/Phantasm, Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell launches an illusory arrow that affects the target's senses to such an extent that they perceive the damage dealt as real, losing 15% of their maximum hit points in unmitigated damage. However, as they are not physically injured, their lost hit points are restored after 3 rounds as the illusion wears off. However, if the afflicted target is mentally incapacitated (stunned, panic, berserk, charmed, feebleminded, confused), the damage dealt is permanent instead. Two arrows are launched from 12th level onwards, three at 19th level, and four at 26th level. The target may make a Saving Throw vs. Spells at -3 to disbelieve the illusion, though a separate save must be made for each individual arrow.~

Level: 3

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2 

The shadow adept launches an unstable mass of shadowstuff which explodes, dealing 1d2 points of magic cold damage (undead creatures suffer magic fire damage instead) and 1d2 points of magic damage for every level of the caster (to a maximum of 10d2 of each) and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1 per 10 levels of the caster (-2 at 10th level, -3 at 20th level, etc.) for 1 turn. Creatures who pass their saving throw (-1 penalty per 5 levels) avoid the direct blast taking no magic damage or stat loss. Targets damaged by Shadowblast also suffer a -20% penalty to all damage dealt for 1 turn.

Against targets that are physically incapacitated (held, asleep, silenced, poisoned, diseased, slowed, blinded), Shadowblast inflicts three times as much damage.~

Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the target loses 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. In addition, the target transfers 3 points of either Strength, Dexterity or Constitution to the caster. The Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points and statistics last for 1 hour.

Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's Hit Points. The caster must wait for the first Lifedrinker Touch spell to run its course before casting another.~

(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Beguile affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms - or attempts to harm - the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Beguile spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.

The saving throw penalty increases by -1 for every 5 caster levels.~

Each meteor bursts into a 1-ft. diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4+3 points of damage plus an additional 3 points of cold damage to any creature struck.

Area of Effect: Path of spear
Saving Throw: Neg.

Upon casting this spell, a spear made of shadowstuff forms in the caster's hands, which can be thrown once towards a target of the caster's choosing. The spear may be launched by any target the caster is able to attack, dispelling all of the spell protections of 5th level and lower affecting it. This includes the following spells: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Minor Spell Turning. If no such spells protect the targets, the spear instead deals 5d6 magic damage and inflicts an additional effect dependent on the caster's level.

5th level and below: Reduces targets' Armor Class by two points for five rounds
8th-10th level: Reduces targets' saving throws and THAC0 by 1 point for five rounds
11th-13th level: Halves targets' Dexterity for one turn
14th-16th level: Drains two levels from targets for one turn
17th level and above: Instantly kills targets

The spear is not affected by Magic Resistance. Targets may make a Saving Throw vs. Death (-1 per spear upgrade) to avoid all secondary effects.~

(Abjuration – Shadow Weave)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Sunder Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the effective level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled (Sunder Magic is cast as though at 1.5x the caster's actual level). The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Sunder Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Sunder Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a shadow adept casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of shadowstuff will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the shadow adept in no way. The effect of this is to protect the shadow adept from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level shadow adept would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level shadow adept would receive 10. For each skin the shadow adept possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level shadow adept would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the shadow adept until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the shadow adept from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.

Additionally, so long as at least one layer of Shadeskin is active, the shadow adept gains 25% resistance to acid, cold, fire, electrical and magic damage.~

The caster creates a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. The target first gets a Save vs. Spells to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Save vs. Death at +2 or die from fear. Even if the second save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

If the target is mentally incapacitated (stunned, panic, berserk, charmed, feebleminded, confused), they are only allowed to make a Saving Throw vs. Death.~

With this spell, the shadow adept conjures a glob of shadowy, vaporous ooze from the Plane of Shadow and drops it on the target, dealing 6d6 acid damage to them and any nearby targets, holding them for 1 round (no save) then slowing them and reducing their magic resistance by 20% for 1 turn.

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen.

Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. Additionally, for as long as the caster is at least partially invisible, <PRO_HESHE> is healed for 2d6 hit points per round for the duration.

Note: After making an attack, the caster is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the caster. The caster is treated as Non-Detected for the duration.~

When the shadow adept casts Black Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical and fire damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster and causes targets to go berserk for 3 rounds. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, they avoid berserking and only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level shadow adept will cause 6d6 (half electrical, half fire) damage to a victim (3d6 electrical if the victim makes <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw vs. Spell).~

Saving Throw: 1/2 

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. Additionally, mages will take 10d4 magic damage and suffer from a 50% chance of spell failure for 2 rounds. Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When the caster utters the spell, he calls forth a swarm of venomous biting and stinging shadow creatures to plague the target. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d6 points of damage from bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. Death at -2 or run away in fear. If a successful Save vs. breath at -6 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

Additionally, the possessed target's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution are increased to 25 while they are possessed. Possess may not be dispelled and the target only regains control over their own body once the duration has ended or if the caster chooses to relinquish control of <PRO_HISHER> own volition.

This powerful but dangerous spell temporarily turns the caster into a gateway for the energies of the Shadow Weave, which <PRO_HESHE> may control and bestow upon <PRO_HISHER> allies within 20' in range for as long as <PRO_HESHE> can maintain it. For an indefinite amount of time, the shadow adept is unable to make any actions as <PRO_HESHE> channels power into <PRO_HISHER> party, providing a +4 bonus to all attributes, +6 to Armor Class, +4 to to-hit and damage modifiers, +50% magic resistance, +50% resistance to elemental damage and immunity to level drain. However, for each round the link is maintained, the caster loses 10% of <PRO_HISHER> hit points (Save vs. Death at -4 to avoid) and <PRO_HESHE> is completely vulnerable to attack unless <PRO_HESHE> breaks the connection. Additionally, if <PRO_HESHE> ends the channel, the backlash causes <PRO_HIMHER> to become stunned for 2 rounds unless a Save vs. Death at -2 is made.~

Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, <PRO_HESHE> calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces bring forth a storm of shadow fire, dealing 6d10 magical fire and magical damage per round with no Saving Throw. Additionally, anyone within the storm must make a Saving Throw vs. Death each round or be petrified permanently. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to attacks of any sort, it will shatter into tiny pieces, making it impossible for the creature to be returned to flesh. The caster is well advised to be careful in <PRO_HISHER> use of this spell.

This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 9
Range: Area centered on caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell inflicts the effects of the Greater Drain Vitality spell upon every enemy creature within the area of effect, draining eight points of Constitution from each target for 1 turn. Drain Vitality (and its variants) does not cost Constitution as other spells of the Shadow Weave and may not affect the same target more than once per turn. Targets who are physically incapacitated (held, asleep, silenced, poisoned, diseased, slowed, blinded) do not make a Saving Throw.~

(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)

Level: 9
Range: 270 ft.
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Only the most desperate of Shadow Adepts dare to call upon this dangerous spell. The caster calls upon a gigantic, meteoric mass of shadowstuff from the Plane of Shadow and drops it upon the target location. Any creature with less than 12 Hit Die are killed instantly with no Saving Throw, while other creatures must make a Saving Throw vs. Breath or die. The meteor deals 5d10 fire damage, 5d10 cold damage, 5d10 electrical damage and 5d10 magic damage to any survivors, knocks them unconscious for 1 round, and reduces their Saving Throws and Luck by -10 for 8 rounds. The strain of channelling this spell, however, causes the caster to suffer 75% of their maximum hit points in damage.

This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.~
